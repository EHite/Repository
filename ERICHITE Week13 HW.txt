## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly _____, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_
Load balancers protect from denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The jump box is the only thing in the network that sees the internet.
It makes it easier to control what goes in and what comes out in one location instead of each virtual machine.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the VMs and system metric
What does Filebeat watch for? Filebeat makes log files and directs them to Elasticsearch or Logstash to be monitored.
What does Metricbeat record? Collects statistics and outputs data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| WEB1     | server   | 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
| WEB-2    | server   | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELKserv  | Elk serv | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the jump box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the jump box.
Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_
40.79.79.44

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 10.0.0.6 10.0.0.7    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
Ansible is efficient, reliable and easy to configure.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
*Installed Docker and Ansible on the Jumpbox machine, enabling playbook automation to push software services to other machines
*Added ELK VM to Hosts file under a separate Group header (elk)
*Run Playbook file via ansible-playbook command, therefore pushing tasks to all machines assigned/configured to receive

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
10.0.0.6 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Filebeat and Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._
Filebeats shows files that are downloaded in the network. It will show what type of file wether it is a zip file or an exe...etc.
Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.
### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the Playbook.yml file to /etc/ansible/roles/Playbook.yml
- Update the hosts file to include elk servers and webservers
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://[your_elk_server_ip]:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
